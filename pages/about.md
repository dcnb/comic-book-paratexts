## About *Comic Book Paratexts*

*Comic Book Paratexts* (*CBP*) is a growing digital collection and scholary resource for the exploration of comic book paratexts. *CPB* aims to provide illustrative examples of the many types of paratexts found in comic books. 

In literary studies, the paratext refers to textual and documentary components surrounding or otherwise associated with a text. Paratexts—extensively explored in Gérard Genette’s *Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation* (1987, 1997)—include titles, dust jackets, prefaces, tables of contents, indices, notes, and epigraphs. Paratextual elements can influence the reception and interpretation of a text.

In the comic book, the “text” is the sequential art, the comics narrative composed of panels, artwork, word balloons, captions, and more. Comic book paratexts include components already mentioned (titles, notes, etc.) along with other elements like advertisements, fan mail, publisher news, and editorial pages. In his essay “Superhero Comics and the Authorizing Functions of the Comic Book Paratext” (2013), Daniel Stein describes comic book paratexts as “productive contact zones between producers and consumers, authors and readers” (p. 160).

For a more extensive overview of paratexts and comic book paratexts, please see the [introductory essay](essay.md).
