## “Here’s What You Get”:<br/>An Introduction to Comic Book Paratexts
**John A. Walsh, Indiana University**

In literary studies, the paratext refers to textual and documentary components surrounding or otherwise associated with a text. Paratexts—extensively explored in Gérard Genette’s _Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation_ (1987, 1997)—include titles, dust jackets, intertitles (such as section or chapter titles), prefaces, tables of contents, indices, certain types of notes, epigraphs, publisher reviews, auto-reviews, interviews and conversations with the author(s), or relevant text from letters and private correspondence. 

Paratextual elements can influence the reception and interpretation of a text. 

The table of contents to Genette's book is a sort of taxonomy of paratexts, with sections devoted to the many different categories of paratexts, such as: cover, title page, name of author, titles, dedications, epigraphs, and so on.

<!-- table of contents -->

In most cases, he discusses the *function* of the particular type of paratext. For instance, Genette write, “the basic function of the original authorial note is to serve as a supplement, sometimes a digression, very rarely a commentary” (p. 327).

In the comic book, the “text” is the sequential art, the comics narrative composed of panels, artwork, word balloons, captions, and more. Comic book paratexts include components already mentioned (titles, notes, etc.) along with other elements like advertisements, letters of comment (i.e., fan mail), and publisher news and editorial pages (e.g., DC’s “Direct Currents” or Marvel’s “Bullpen Bulletins).

Genette writes: 

> paratext = peritext + epitext (p. 5)

Genette divides the paratext into two general catagories: _**peritexts**_, that exist within the same volume (or the same floppy comic book): 

> Within the same volume are elements such as the title or the preface and sometimes elements inserted into the interstices of the text, such as chapter titles or certain notes (Genette, pp. 4-5).

The second category is _**epitexts**_, those paratexts that exist outside the physical volume (or floppy comic): 

> [A]ll those messages that, at least originally, are located outside the book, generally with the backing of the media (interviews, conversations), or under cover of private communication (letters, diaries, and others) (Genette, p. 5)

Some comparative examples from traditional literary texts and comics illustrate these concepts.

### Peritexts

#### Covers

{% include feature/image.html objectid="assets/img/swinburne-sbs-cover.jpg" width="75" alt="Cover to Algernon Charles Swinburne’s Songs Before Sunrise (1871), designed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti." caption="Cover to Algernon Charles Swinburne’s Songs Before Sunrise (1871), designed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

In 1871, Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne published _Songs Before Sunrise_, a collection of poems, including many political poems supporting Italy's struggles for independence in the 19th century. The cover was designed by Swinburne’s close friend, poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a Italian-British poet and artist and a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, an influential of young rebellious artists. The cover design by Rossetti acknowledges and emphasizes Swinburne’s personal relationship with Rossetti and his affiliation with the Pre-Raphaelite artists and poets.

A cover from a 1970s Marvel comic book explicitly and implicitly provides a wealth of information. The cover includes the series title, “Captain America”; a story title, “‘Madbomb’: It Can Destroy the World!”; biblographic information, such as publisher (“Marvel Comics Group”) and issue number (“193 JAN”); price (25¢); content advisory, “Approved by the Comics Code Authority”; artists’ names (“J. Kirby + J. Romita”), and publisher’s announcement on the return of longtime artist Jack Kirby, “King Kirby is back -- and greater than ever!”.

This cover includes information on creators not found elsewhere in the document. For instance, the formal credits on the interior splash page (See fig. x) omit John Romita, who inked Jack Kirby’s pencils for the document’s cover (see fig. ) .

The rather inconspicuous seal of the Comics Code Authority, present on the cover of most American comics from 19XX to XXX, signals the fraught and complicated history of the 1950s campaign against comics, spearheaded by psychologist Frederic Wertham. Wertham argued that comics were . Senate hearings. Librarians. Comics Code Authority.

#### Title pages

The interior splash page, a standard feature of many mainstream commercial comics, repeats information and partexts found on the cover, such as the publisher, the name of the creators, and the story title. However, commonly, the interior story title is a variant of the title found on the cover. In this case, the cover reads, “‘Madbomb’ It Can Destroy the World!” while this interior title reads “The Madbomb Screamer in the Brain!” The result is two paratextual titles competing with, commenting on, and amplifying one another.

The indicia, also typically found on the interior splash page, includes imortant bibliographic information include the publisher, publisher location and address, volume and issue number, date, and legal disclaimers.

Genette’s paratext categories include “intertitles,” or interior titles such as chapter and section titles, and we find many examples of these in comics.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="cbp_0023" width="75" alt="An “intertitle,” or interior title, introducing a Patsy Walker story in Miss America #64 (June 1954)" caption="An “intertitle,” or interior title, introducing a Patsy Walker story in Miss America #64 (June 1954)"%}

#### Dedications
Dedications are another type of paratext discussed by Genette and a common feature of traditional literary texts. Again we draw examples from Swinburne. In the first case we see the dedicattion to the painter Edward Burne Jones, a close friend of Swinburne. The dedication is from Swinburne’s most famous volume, _Poems and Ballads_ (1866). A second example is an implied dedication to one of Swinburne’s literary heroes, Victor Hugo, on the occasion of Hugo’s 78th birthday.

While they are not as frequent as in non-graphic literary texts such as novels, plays, and volumes of poetry, dedications are also present in comics books. As in the three examples below, comic book dedictions often indicate a debt of gratitude to comics creators from an earlier generation.  In the first example, writer Roy Thomas dedications a Sub-Mariner story from _Sub-Mariner_ #32 (June 1971) to Bill Everett, who in 1939 created the Sub-Mariner character. Everett passed away less than two years after the publication of this dedication, in February 1973, at the age of 55.

Another example is writer/artist Jim Starlin’s dedication to artist Steve Ditko in a story featuring the character Adam Warlock, from _Strange Tales_ #181 (August 1975), to artist Steve Ditko. The entire page is a visual dedication implied by Starlin positioning Adam Warlock within a psychedelic dreamscape that echoes similar dreamscapes introduced by Ditko in his work on Marvel’s Doctor Strange, who first appeared in the same title in _Strange Tales_ #110 (July 1963). But there is also an explicit paratextual dedication: “This story is dedicated to Steve Ditko, who gave us all a different reality.”

Grant Morrison’s dedication in _Animal Man_ #8 (February 1989) bucks convention by including fictional character Barry Allen among comics creators John Broome, Gardner Fox, and Carmine Infantino.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="cbp_0003" width="75" alt="A dedication to “John Broome, Gardner Fox, Carmine Infantino and the late, great Barry Allen” in Animal Man #8 (February 1989). DC Comics." caption="A dedication to “John Broome, Gardner Fox, Carmine Infantino and the late, great Barry Allen” in Animal Man #8 (February 1989). DC Comics."%}

Derf Backderf’s dedication to his friend Doug Buckner appears in his hardbound book-length documentary comic _Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio_ (2020). Suggesting the influence of physical format on the book’s contents, this dedication, appearing in a hardbound book, more closely resembles, visually and rhetorically, a formal dedication found in a traditional literary work than the examples above of in-panel dedications found in “floppy” comic books.

#### Epigraphs

Epigraphs, which are short quotations, often with a bibliographic citation for the source of the quotation, at the beginning of a book, chapter, or poem. Like dedications to literary and artistic figures, epigraphs can suggest creative debt or influence. They also designate a specific intertextual relationship between the quoted text and the work in which the epigraph appears. There are at least three agents involved in an epigraph, as described by Genette:

> [T]he attribution of the quotation raises two theoretically distinct questions, although neither is as simple as it appears to be: Who is the author, real or putative, of the text quoted? Who chooses and proposes that quotation? I will call the author the _epigraphed_; and the person who chooses or proposes, I will call the _epigrapher_, or sender of the epigraph (its addressee — no doubt the reader of the text - being, if you insist, the _epigraphee_). (pp. 150-151)

Genette goes on to identify four functions of an epigraph. 

1. “elucidating and thereby justifying not the text but the _title_” (p. 156);
2. “commenting on the _text_” (p. 157); 
3. implicitly dedicating the work to the individual quoted (p. 159);
4. marking, by an epigraph’s presence or absence, “the period, the genre, or the tenor” of a piece of writing (p. 160).

Below is another nineteenth-century example from Swinburne. At the head of his poem “Anactoria” from his 1866 volume _Poems and Ballads_, Swinburne quotes the Greek poet Sappho. “Anactoria” is a dramatic monologue in which the speaker, Sappho, addresses her lover, Anactoria. 

>                 τίνος αὖ τὺ πειθοῖ  
> μὰψ σαγηνεύσασ φιλότατα ;   
>                                  <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sappho.</span>

{% include feature/image.html objectid="assets/img/swinburne-anactoria-epigraph.jpg" width="75" alt="Epigraph quoting Greek poet Sappho, from Algernon Charles Swinburne’s “Anactoria” (1866)." caption="Epigraph quoting Greek poet Sappho, from Algernon Charles Swinburne’s “Anactoria” (1866). Image from the HathiTrust Digital Library: https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t17m0815m."%}

The epigraph to Swinburne’s “Anactoria” accomplishes all the functions set by Genette. The poem is a tortured and passionate address by Sappho, and the identification of Sappho in the epigraph elucidates, amplifies, and justifies the poem’s title. Haynes notes, “The epigraph is an emendation, perhaps Swinburne’s own, of a corrupt line in [Sappho’s] Aphrodite Ode; Swinburne’s version means, ‘Whose love have you caught in vain by persuasion?’” (p. 333). In the Aphrodite Ode, the speaker calls upon the goddess Aphrodite for aid in the pursuit of an unnamed lover. Thus, both Swinburne’s poem and Sappho’s amplify one another. 

Among Swinburne’s many literary heroes is the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. We find an excellent example of a comic book epigraph in Roy Thomas’s use of Shelley’s sonnet “Ozymandias” (1818) in _Avengers_ #57 (October 1968).

{% include feature/image.html objectid="cbp_0110" width="75" alt="A terminal epigraph quoting the whole of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s sonnet “Ozymandias” (1818) from Avengers #57 (October 1968)" caption="A terminal epigraph quoting the whole of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s sonnet “Ozymandias” (1818) from Avengers #57 (October 1968)"%}

Below is the full text of Shelley’s poem:

> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">I met</span> a traveller from an antique land  
> Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,      
> Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,    
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:  
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”  
> No thing beside remains. Round the decay  
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.  

#### Advertisements
For many mainstream American comic books, advertisements are by far the most common type of paratext. A single page of a silver or bronze-age comic could contain a dozen or more small advertisements.

The single double-page spread below includes 37 separate advertisements. The size and density of the ads is reminiscent of classified advertisements found in newspapers.

Many comic book advertisements co-opt formal elements from comics. For example, the advertisement below for “Big Jim’s P.A.C.K.” action figures This advertisement for Big Jim’s P.A.C.K. action figures incorporates comics-styled illustration, lettering and typography, captions, and word balloons.

A 1968 advertisement for International Correspondence Schools (ICS) completely abandons traditional ad copy, format, and structure, instead employing the comics format to tell the fictional story of a high school dropout who becomes a success by using the advertised product. 

<!-- add from FF #78 -->

Those interested in topics such as gender roles in comics will find much of interest in comics advertisements. The advertisement below is recruiting comic book readers to sell _Grit_ newspaper in their neighborhood. The recruiting message is addressed to “Fellows” and continues “If you’re a boy 12 years old or older, you can be a happy, prosperous GRIT salesman.” The mail-in form asks, “Are you a boy?” 

Later versions of this advertisement would replace “Look, Fellows!” with “Look, Friends!” and “Are You a Boy?” with “Male or Female?”

#### Publisher’s paratext: editorials and news

#### Correspondence

#### Notes

#### Documentary partexts

Genette does devote a full chapter or section of his seminal book to “documentary” paratexts, but in his conclusion he writes, “[T]his inventory of paratextual elements remains incomplete … For instance, certain elements of the documentary paratext that are characteristic of didactic works are sometimes appended, with or without playful intent, to works of fiction” (p. 404). He goes on to list a number of examples: 

> Senancour's Oberman includes a sort of thematic index called “Indications,” arranged in alphabetical order (*Adversité, Aisance, Amitié* [Adversity, Ease, Friendship] …); *Moby-Dick* opens with a comprehensive documentary dossier about whales; Updike's *Bech: A Book* ends with an imaginary bibliography of works by and studies about the hero (the studies are attributed apocryphally to real critics); the “appendix” of Perec's *Vie mode d’emploi* [*Life: A User's Manual*] contains a floor plan of the building, an index of persons and places, a chronology, a list of authors quoted, and an “Alphabetical Checklist of Some of the Stories Narrated in this Manual.” Novelistic works like Zola's *Rougon-Macquart*, Thackeray's *Henry Esmond*, Nabokov's *Ada*, or Renaud Camus's *Roman roi* contain family trees constructed by the authors themselves. For the *Portable Faulkner* of 1946, Faulkner drew a map of Yoknapatawpha County; and Umberto Eco drew a plan of the abbey in The *Name of the Rose*. (pp. 404-405)

Documentary paratexts are not uncommon in comics, and they are of particular interests because, like epigraphs and notes, they are generally created by the creators (writers and artists) of the main comics narrative, and they are conceptually coloser to the “text” than many other comic book paratexts, like fan correspondence and advertisements. For instance, a sectional view of the Baxter Building, headquarters of Marvel’s Fantastic Four superhero team, provides spatial contexts to narratives about the Fantastic Four. These sectional views are intended as persistent reference material for readers. An [example by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby from 1963](items/cbp_0924.html) implores readers to “Save for future reference!” [Another, by Marv Wolfman and Kieth Pollard, from 1968](items/cbp_0927.html) announces itself as a “handy-dandy reference.”  Similarly, a map of the “Hyperborian Age of Conan” adds spatial contexts to stories about Robert E. Howards fictional world and its inhabitants.

Howard.” Savage Sword of Conan #14 (September 1976). Marvel Comics."%}

Less narrative-focused documentary paratexts include “pin-up” pages of popular characters, often with explanatory text and bibliographic details about notabler appearances of the character. Like the sectional views of the Fantastic Four’s Baxter building, these pin-ups also serve as reference material, with a short biography of the featured character and bibliographic information about the character’s first appearance.

### Epitexts

Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, authored a number of important epitexts that illuminate his poetry and contextualize within English poetry and the larger canon of Western literature. In his edition of three of Swinburne’s epitexts, Clyde Kenneth Hyder writes that these “systematic replies to [Swinburne’s] critics” contained “imaginative interpretations of their author’s own poems or acute criticism of other poets, as well as stimulating observations on poetry in general” (p. vii).

{% include feature/pdf.html objectid="assets/pdf/swinburne-notes-on-poems-and-reviews.pdf" alt="Algernon Charles Swinburne’s Notes on Poems and Reviews (1866)" caption="Algernon Charles Swinburne’s Notes on Poems and Reviews (1866). PDF provided by the Internet Archive and University of California Libraries. http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/13960/t8pc33t1m" %}

In “Notes on Poems and Reviews” (1866), Swinburne is responding to attacks upon his recently published volume _Poems and Ballads_ (1866). “Notes” is mechanism, and epitext outside the physical and conceptual confines of the _Poems and Ballads_ volume, by which Swinburne can respond to his critics and speak to his readers, his fellow poets, and the larger literary world about his poetry. Similarly, comic book creators use epitextual mechanisms for such communications. These epitexts may be found in comics-related books, newspapers, magazines, and fanzines, on radio and television, and in audio and video recordings of panels and interviews at comic book conventions and similar events.

However, most comic book’s are not “discursive” documents. They are works of fiction. And many are serial works of fiction. Many of the notes in serial comics function to educaton the reader about the long serial continuity of comics, the expansive fictional worlds in which many comics take place. They explain events that occur in previous issues of the serial publicaton or in separate publications from the same publisher and fictional world or universe.
