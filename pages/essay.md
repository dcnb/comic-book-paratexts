# Comic Book Paratexts
**John A. Walsh, Indiana University**

In literary studies, the paratext refers to textual and documentary components surrounding or otherwise associated with a text. Paratexts—extensively explored in Gérard Genette’s _Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation_ (1987, 1997)—include titles, dust jackets, intertitles (such as section or chapter titles), prefaces, tables of contents, indices, certain types of notes, epigraphs, publisher reviews, auto-reviews, interviews and conversations with the author(s), or relevant text from letters and private correspondence. 

Paratextual elements can influence the reception and interpretation of a text. 

The table of contents to Genette's book is a sort of taxonomy of paratexts, with sections devoted to the many different categories of paratexts, such as: cover, title page, name of author, titles, dedications, epigraphs, and so on.

In most cases, he discusses the *function* of the particular type of paratext. For instance, Gennette identifies four functions of an epigraph:

> 1. function of "commenting … and thus of elucidating and thereby justifying … the *title*," or the reverse "when the title modifies the meaning of the epigraph."(156-157)
> 2. "commenting upon the *text*, whose meaning it indirectly specifies or emphasizes." (157)
> 3. providing "the sense of indirect backing" of the author quoted.
> 4. marking "the period, the genre, or the tenor of a piece of writing," since epigraphs are more in fashion in particular periods, genres or tenors. 

In the comic book, the “text” is the sequential art, the comics narrative composed of panels, artwork, word balloons, captions, and more. Comic book paratexts include components already mentioned (titles, notes, etc.) along with other elements like advertisements, letters of comment (i.e., fan mail), and publisher news and editorial pages (e.g., DC’s “Direct Currents” or Marvel’s “Bullpen Bulletins).

Genette writes: 

> paratext = peritext + epitext (p. 5)

Genette divides the paratext into two general catagories: _**peritexts**_, that exist within the same volume (or the same floppy comic book): 

> Within the same volume are elements such as the title or the preface and sometimes elements inserted into the interstices of the text, such as chapter titles or certain notes (Genette, pp. 4-5).

The second category is _**epitexts**_, those paratexts that exist outside the physical volume (or floppy comic): 

> [A]ll those messages that, at least originally, are located outside the book, generally with the backing of the media (interviews, conversations), or under cover of private communication (letters, diaries, and others) (Genette, p. 5)

Some comparative examples from traditional literary texts and comics illustrate these concepts.

In 1871, Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne published _Songs Before Sunrise_, a collection of poems, including many political poems supporting Italy's struggles for independence in the 19th century. The cover was designed by Swinburne’s close friend, poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a Italian-British poet and artist and a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, an influential of young rebellious artists. The cover design by Rossetti acknowledges and emphasizes a number of relationships, associations, and influences.

## slide 9
- series title
- story title
- publisher
- promotional blurb about a creator, Kirby
- price 
- issue number
- month
- content seal of approval

## slide 10
- signed work, creators names
- only place we see Romita

## slide 11
- content advisories
- comics code authorization
- Of course the presence of the small comics code seal as a paratext carries with it an enormous load of important political and cultural baggage.

## slide 12
- the interior title page or splash page contains other implications
- We often have an alternate story title, as in this case. The cover reads, “‘Madbomb’ It Can Destroy the World!” while this interior title reads “The Madbomb Screamer in the Brain!”
- So we now have two paratextual titles competing with, commenting on, and amplifying one another.

## slide 13
- In the credits in the top third of the page and the indicia below, we have important bibliographic information:
	- creators
	- publisher
	- publisher location and address
	- volume and issue number
	- date
	- legal disclaimers and more

## slide 14
Genette includes interior title pages, chapter titles, secttion titles, etc. as paratexts, and we find these also in comics.

- Here's a chapter title from a DC Kamandi Comic

## slide 15
An interior title from a Golden Age anthology comics, Fantastic Comics #15

## slide 17: Dedications
From Victorian poet. In the first case a book is dedicated to the Pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne Jones. Below a poem is written for the birthday of Victor Hugo, one of Swinburne's literary heroes.

## slide 18
- Starlin dedicating a story to Ditko. You have the implied visual dedication to Ditko with Adam Warlock position in a typical Ditko-esque universe. But there is also the explicit written paratextual dedication, “This story is dedicated to Steve Ditko, who gave us all a different reality.”
