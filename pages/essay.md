# Comic Book Paratexts
**John A. Walsh, Indiana University**

In literary studies, the paratext refers to textual and documentary components surrounding or otherwise associated with a text. Paratexts—extensively explored in Gérard Genette’s _Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation_ (1987, 1997)—include titles, dust jackets, intertitles (such as section or chapter titles), prefaces, tables of contents, indices, certain types of notes, epigraphs, publisher reviews, auto-reviews, interviews and conversations with the author(s), or relevant text from letters and private correspondence. 

Paratextual elements can influence the reception and interpretation of a text. 

The table of contents to Genette's book is a sort of taxonomy of paratexts, with sections devoted to the many different categories of paratexts, such as: cover, title page, name of author, titles, dedications, epigraphs, and so on.

In most cases, he discusses the *function* of the particular type of paratext. For instance, Gennette identifies four functions of an epigraph:

> 1. function of "commenting … and thus of elucidating and thereby justifying … the *title*," or the reverse "when the title modifies the meaning of the epigraph."(156-157)
> 2. "commenting upon the *text*, whose meaning it indirectly specifies or emphasizes." (157)
> 3. providing "the sense of indirect backing" of the author quoted.
> 4. marking "the period, the genre, or the tenor of a piece of writing," since epigraphs are more in fashion in particular periods, genres or tenors. 

In the comic book, the “text” is the sequential art, the comics narrative composed of panels, artwork, word balloons, captions, and more. Comic book paratexts include components already mentioned (titles, notes, etc.) along with other elements like advertisements, letters of comment (i.e., fan mail), and publisher news and editorial pages (e.g., DC’s “Direct Currents” or Marvel’s “Bullpen Bulletins).

Genette writes: 

> paratext = peritext + epitext (p. 5)

Genette divides the paratext into two general catagories: _**peritexts**_, that exist within the same volume (or the same floppy comic book): 

> Within the same volume are elements such as the title or the preface and sometimes elements inserted into the interstices of the text, such as chapter titles or certain notes (Genette, pp. 4-5).

The second category is _**epitexts**_, those paratexts that exist outside the physical volume (or floppy comic): 

> [A]ll those messages that, at least originally, are located outside the book, generally with the backing of the media (interviews, conversations), or under cover of private communication (letters, diaries, and others) (Genette, p. 5)

Some comparative examples from traditional literary texts and comics illustrate these concepts.

In 1871, Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne published _Songs Before Sunrise_, a collection of poems, including many political poems supporting Italy's struggles for independence in the 19th century. The cover was designed by Swinburne’s close friend, poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a Italian-British poet and artist and a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, an influential of young rebellious artists. The cover design by Rossetti acknowledges and emphasizes Swinburne’s personal relationship with Rossetti and his affiliation with the Pre-Raphaelite artists and poets.

A cover from a 1970s Marvel comic book explicitly and implicitly provides a wealth of information. The cover includes the series title, “Captain America”; a story title, “‘Madbomb’: It Can Destroy the World!”; biblographic information, such as publisher (“Marvel Comics Group”) and issue number (“193 JAN”); price (25¢); content advisory, “Approved by the Comics Code Authority”; artists’ names (“J. Kirby + J. Romita”), and publisher’s announcement on the return of longtime artist Jack Kirby, “King Kirby is back -- and greater than ever!”.

This cover includes information on creators not found elsewhere in the document. For instance, the formal credits on the interior splash page (See fig. x) omit John Romita, who inked Jack Kirby’s pencils for the document’s cover (see fig. ) .

The rather inconspicuous seal of the Comics Code Authority, present on the cover of most American comics from 19XX to XXX, signals the fraught and complicated history of the 1950s campaign against comics, spearheaded by psychologist Frederic Wertham. Wertham argued that comics were . Senate hearings. Librarians. Comics Code Authority.

The interior splash page, a standard feature of many mainstream commercial comics, repeats information and partexts found on the cover, such as the publisher, the name of the creators, and the story title. However, commonly, the interior story title is a variant of the title found on the cover. In this case, the cover reads, “‘Madbomb’ It Can Destroy the World!” while this interior title reads “The Madbomb Screamer in the Brain!” The result is two paratextual titles competing with, commenting on, and amplifying one another.

The indicia, also typically found on the interior splash page, includes imortant bibliographic information include the publisher, publisher location and address, volume and issue number, date, and legal disclaimers.

Genette’s paratext categories include “intertitles,” or interior titles such as chapter and section titles, and we find many examples of these in comics.

## Dedications
Dedications are another type of paratext discussed by Genette and a common feature of traditional literary texts. Again we draw examples from Swinburne. In the first case we see the dedicattion to the painter Edward Burne Jones, a close friend of Swinburne. The dedication is from Swinburne’s most famous volume, _Poems and Ballads_ (1866). A second example is an implied dedication to one of Swinburne’s literary heroes, Victor Hugo, on the occasion of Hugo’s 78th birthday.

While they are not as frequent as in non-graphic literary texts such as novels, plays, and volumes of poetry, dedications are also present in comics books. As in the three examples below, comic book dedictions often indicate a debt of gratitude to comics creators from an earlier generation.  In the first example, writer Roy Thomas dedications a Sub-Mariner story from _Sub-Mariner_ #32 (June 1971) to Bill Everett, who in 1939 created the Sub-Mariner character. Everett passed away less than two years after the publication of this dedication, in February 1973, at the age of 55.

Another example is writer/artist Jim Starlin’s dedication to artist Steve Ditko in a story featuring the character Adam Warlock, from _Strange Tales_ #181 (August 1975), to artist Steve Ditko. The entire page is a visual dedication implied by Starlin positioning Adam Warlock within a psychedelic dreamscape that echoes similar dreamscapes introduced by Ditko in his work on Marvel’s Doctor Strange, who first appeared in the same title in _Strange Tales_ #110 (July 1963). But there is also an explicit paratextual dedication: “This story is dedicated to Steve Ditko, who gave us all a different reality.”

Grant Morrison’s dedication in _Animal Man_ #8 (February 1989) bucks convention by including fictional character Barry Allen among comics creators John Broome, Gardner Fox, and Carmine Infantino.

DC Comics." caption="A dedication to “John Broome, Gardner Fox, Carmine Infantino and the late, great Barry Allen” in Animal Man #8 (February 1989). DC Comics."%}

Derf Backderf’s dedication to his friend Doug Buckner appears in his hardbound book-length documentary comic _Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio_ (2020). Suggesting the influence of physical format on the book’s contents, this dedication, appearing in a hardbound book, more closely resembles, visually and rhetorically, a formal dedication found in a traditional literary work than the examples above of in-panel dedications found in “floppy” comic books.

## Epigraphs

Epigraphs, which are short quotations, often with a bibliographic citation for the source of the quotation, at the beginning of a book, chapter, or poem. Like dedications to literary and artistic figures, epigraphs can suggest creative debt or influence. They also designate a specific intertextual relationship between the quoted text and the work in which the epigraph appears. There are at least three agents involved in an epigraph, as described by Genette:

> [T]he attribution of the quotation raises two theoretically distinct questions, although neither is as simple as it appears to be: Who is the author, real or putative, of the text quoted? Who chooses and proposes that quotation? I will call the author the _epigraphed_; and the person who chooses or proposes, I will call the _epigrapher_, or sender of the epigraph (its addressee — no doubt the reader of the text - being, if you insist, the _epigraphee_). (pp. 150-151)

Genette goes on to identify four functions of an epigraph. 

1. “elucidating and thereby justifying not the text but the _title_” (p. 156);
2. “commenting on the _text_” (p. 157); 
3. implicitly dedicating the work to the individual quoted (p. 159);
4. marking, by an epigraph’s presence or absence, “the period, the genre, or the tenor” of a piece of writing (p. 160).
